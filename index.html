        <h2 class="ideas">What It Takes To Form A Successful Band</h2>
        <p class="ideas">Before you even think about getting members together you need to make sure you have a practice space that will not get you in trouble for noise! Not all neighbors are fans of music or supportive of local bands. So ask your neighbors FIRST before setting up.
           Some Great places in Boise is the Hive and the Boise Bomb Shelter located off of Bogus Basin Rd across from Highlands Elementary. I have rented 3 rooms there in the past 15 years and they have tons of options and tons of rooms, 
           but get on the waiting list ASAP because it is a very popular place for musicians to practice.</p>
           <h3 class="ideas">Recording</h3>
            <p class="ideas">Once you have a solid set of songs you will want to record them in a professional studio. Everyone thinks they can record themselves… DO NOT DO THAT! It takes years of experience to master tracks, know mic placement, how to set up a recording room and to have the proper mics and vocal booths and drum booths that will give you a clean sound. It will set you apart from so many other local bands who try and record and it turns out sounding worse than recording on your Iphone. Make a demo or if you have enough material make an album! If you are a cover band put together a great list of songs and just get them recorded. You need to have solid recordings if you are going to get gigs.</p>

<div class="box">What are Antioxidants?</box>
</div>
<p>Whether you are combating physical illness or simply want to strengthen your immune system and feel better, the benefits of OPC Factor will surprise you!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Known as oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) are the most powerful antioxidants known to man – 20-50 times more powerful than vitamins C and E. OPCs are rapidly absorbed and quickly distributed throughout the body as a free radical fighter, thereby reducing the potential for free radical damage and the ravages of aging.

</p>    

<div class="position">
    <p><tbody>When we first began researching the best antioxidant in 1994, we began with the pine bark from the maritime pine trees. 
        It is equally as important as the grape seed extract including the vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and proprietary blend. The key differences of OPC Factor include:

    <p>Supplementing With Immune System Boosters Can Help.
        Providing your body with strong immune system support by supplementing with immune system boosters is the key to helping it fight off disease and maintain its health.
        
        Using antioxidants as an immune system support is essential in your ability to ward off diseases that shorten life and disrupt our quality of life.
        
        The primary job of the immune system is to protect our bodies against disease. The immune system is a collection of cells that seek out and destroy bacteria, viruses, precancerous and cancer cells, and any other dangerous foreign invader or toxin.</p>
    <p>As we age, our immune system loses its vigor making us more susceptible to diseases we would have easily shaken off in our youth.

        To keep our antioxidant immune system network strong and effective, we must constantly replenish the antioxidants we lose every second of every day.
        
        What we feed our body determines if we keep our bodies and minds functioning at optimal levels. Of course, there is no substitute for a healthy, well balanced diet. Supplementing with immune system boosters can help enhance the health benefits of food but cannot do the job alone.
        
        Cell Essentials OPC Factor, a new product from AlivenLabs, acts both as an antioxidant and an immune system boosters. It helps maintain healthy immune system function by restoring cytokine imbalances and increasing white blood cell activity.</p>

<h3 id="anim">Information and Stories</h3>

<p>The Two Jacks: A Brief History of OPCs
    Two men, centuries apart, helped bring to light the amazing benefits of OPCs.
    
    The year was 1535 and a French explorer by the name of Jacques Cartier was off sailing up the Saint Lawrence River in present-day Quebec when his ship became trapped in ice for five long months.
    
    Due to the lack of sufficient fruits and vegetables, Cartier and his crew became severely malnourished and as a result were struck with a mystery illness that caused their gums to bleed, their legs to swell and their entire bodies to become extremely weak. Today we know this illness as scurvy.
    
    Only after the deaths of several crew members did the remaining men follow the advice of the local Iroquois tribe and drink a strange brew the Indians concocted using the bark of a local pine tree, the white cedar.
    
    In his account, Voyages au Canada, Cartier wrote:
    
    “As soon as they had drunk it they felt better which surely must be ascribed to miraculous causes; for after drinking it two or three times they recovered health and strength and were cured of all the diseases they had ever had…”
    
    Once cured, Cartier and his men sailed on into the history books by blessing us with the country of Canada.
    
    Fast forward more than 400 years to the same place (Canada), and to another guy named Jacques ( “Jack” Masquelier), a French researcher at the University of Quebec, who read Cartier’s story and began to study the bark of these pine trees.
    
    Dr. Masquelier’s research confirmed Cartier’s account and the healing properties of the bark’s compounds he called oligomeric proanthocyanidins, or OPCs for short. Masquelier found that OPCs strengthened the walls of the blood vessels and capillaries and improve vascular functions vital for the health of all of the body’s organs. He also was able to find these compounds existing in other plants like the seeds and skins of red wine grapes.
    
    It wasn’t until 1985 that Dr. Masquelier discovered that a partial explanation for the awesome results from OPCs were their ability to neutralize free radicals and act as ‘super antioxidants’‚ 20 times more powerful than Vitamin C and 50 times more powerful than Vitamin E. Because they help to prevent oxidation in our cells OPCs are believed to slow and even reverse much of the aging process!
    
    Today we can extract these OPC compounds from pine bark, grape seeds, grape skins, green tea, lemon bioflavanoids, and bilberry, among other plants. OPC Factor can really be considered a ‘super’ OPC supplement because it combines many OPCs (all of the aforementioned) from multiple plant sources into a single supplement. This gives OPC Factor the ability to strengthen your capillaries so that vital nutrients can be passed to the cells. Oh, and we have those nutrients too!
    
    It’s been nearly 500 years since man’s first recorded encounter with the awesome healing power of OPCs. We don’t have to tell you their effects can lead to miraculous results‚ heck, Cartier said that himself!
    
    Sometimes I imagine how his account would have read had he been given OPC Factor instead of that strange brew. I imagine his entry would have included one slight addition:
    
    “Where can I get a box of this stuff?”
    
     
    
    Good Question
    
    Q:
    
    I see a lot of advertisements and grocery store displays promoting various tropical juices containing mangosteen, Acai and Goji berries, etc that claim to be high in antioxidants. Are these juices more powerful than OPC Factor since they are already mixed naturally
    
    A:
    
    No. I appreciated getting this question because these companies do spend tons of money making you think they are great for you. Even Dr. Dean Adell states that these are just high priced juices.
    
    Not only are they NOT MORE powerful but they aren’t even AS powerful. And there are two reasons that they do not deliver results as good as OPC Factor.
    
    The first reason is absorbability. While these products, which are many times blends of apple and grape juices, they contain fruits with high antioxidant profiles, they also contain other ingredients such as sugar that, along with the digestive acids in the stomach cancel out the good ingredients.
    
    The second reason they aren’t as powerful is pretty easy to understand. Just look at the ingredients on the juice container and compare it to the ingredients on a box or packet of OPC Factor. There’s your answer! These juices just don’t contain the sheer volume of antioxidants, nutrients, vitamins, herbs, extracts, enzymes and minerals that OPC Factor does. They basically take one of their current juices, which are all high in sugar, and add the newest and hottest antioxidant trend so they can put it on the label.
    
    Best regards,</p>

<p>“Average Lifespan in years for men and women in the U.S. is 80,” says Steven Austad of the American Federation for Aging Research. 

    “Will people eventually routinely live – and live healthily – longer?”  WSJ Thursday, 1/13/22, A Pill to Turn Back the Clock
    
    The article asks: “Can we slow, prevent, or reverse the aging process for humans?”
    
    OPC Factor is filled with super antioxidants that work synergistically at the cellular level.  Antioxidants are designed to fight free radicals that generate in our bodies or come from outside sources.  Free radicals cause oxidative stress, an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defenses.  
    
    Free radicals harmfully alter lipids, proteins, DNA, and trigger several diseases:
    
   <h5>OXIDATIVE STRESS:</h5>
    
     <ul>LUNGS:  
        <li>Asthma</li>
    <li>Chronic bronchitis</li>

    <li>Heart failure</li>
   </ul>
    Again, free radicals are highly unstable and reactive, lacking in unpaired electrons in orbit.  They attack other healthy molecules and “steal” the electron resulting in creating another free radical that in turn repeats the process and damages multiple molecules.  When we have antioxidants that have multiple electrons to “give” away, the human body can then have the tools (antioxidants) necessary to stop cellular damage. 
    
    Some Sources of Free Radicals:
    
    Smoking
    Alcohol
    Pollutants:  Environmental, industrial 
    Radiation
    Drugs
    Pesticides
    Industrial solvents
    Conclusion:
    
    It stands to reason that Antioxidants play a vital role in maintaining our health, aging, and well-being at a cellular level.
    
    OPC Factor is designed to be a role in helping to improve cell function providing multiple electrons to damaged cells with powerful fighting antioxidants in a bioavailable, effervescent form.

<p>Is There a Super Antioxidant?
    Sluggish?  Feeling low on energy?  You may need to improve blood circulation.  Improving blood circulation is easy since antioxidants are nature’s remedy to increase blood viscosity.  Antioxidants help prevent the formation of free radicals which are one of the known causes of cell damage, weak artery walls, and increased blood viscosity.
    
    Antioxidants are important because they can stop some of the free radical damage that occurs in aging, degenerative diseases, and weakened immune systems – thereby helping to build immune system strength.
    
    Is There a Super Antioxidant?
    
    Red wine is probably the most famous antioxidant. Research has shown that a glass of red wine a day can help improve blood circulation and heart health. But did you know that the antioxidant OPC is responsible for red wine’s ‘healing power’?
    
    OPCs are found in:
    
    grape seed
    grape skin
    pine bark
    OPCs are the most powerful antioxidants known today.  Since they have more electron bonding points than other antioxidants, they neutralize free radicals up to 50 times better than other sources of antioxidants.
    
    The Path to Health
    
    AlivenLabs created a super antioxidant OPC product called Cell Essentials OPC Factor that not only contains the powerful vitamins and minerals you need, but in a liquid form that is both isotonic and effervescent.
    
    Unlike red wine which is acidic in nature, when Cell Essentials OPC Factor is ingested into the stomach, digestive juices and acids are not triggered, and instead Cell Essentials OPC Factor can move straight into the small intestine for absorption into the blood. This method makes Cell Essentials OPC Factor  97% absorbed and into your blood stream, handily beating the 20% effectiveness that the Physicians Desk Reference claims pills provide – by a long shot.
    
    Now is the time to try Cell Essentials OPC Factor and see for yourself how it can improve your quality of life.</p>
