            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <h4>Speakers</h4>
            <ul> <li>Passive speakers are the older type of speakers and you will need an amp to power them. Active speakers come with their own power supply (recommended)</li>
            <li>Two 15″ and Two 12″ speakers is a great start. The 15’s will give you the lower sound (I recommend boosting the Low’s on a 5 channel EQ for these) The 12’s will be great for monitors especially so you can hear your vocals (I recommend boosting the mids on a 5 channel EQ for these)</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Microphones</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>SM58 Great vocal mic for practicing.</li>
                  <li>SM57’s are the industry standard for recording most mid – high frequency instruments. (guitars, keys, snare drum, toms)</li>
                  <li>Audio Technika makes great low end mics. (bass, kick drum) ALWAYS know your frequency response of your microphones and what you think will work best for what you are going to mic up.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Misc.</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Cords! Speaker/Instrument cords and mic cords LOTS!</li>
                <li>Instrument Cords- You’ll need one for each of your electronic instruments plus going to your speakers from your mixing board.</li>
                <li>Mixing Board- Get a simple 10-16 Channel Mixing Board. As fun as it sounds just putting guitar amps, bass amps, drums and mics in a room and turning them up to 11 It’s very difficult to get a good mix of the music. Plus all artists think they can’t hear themselves and need to be louder than everyone else. It can be… frustrating to say the least. If you mic up all your guitar/bass cabs, drums, and any other musical instrument you have then it is a lot easier for someone with a good ear to manage the sound board to mix the music. A good mix is key when practicing. If you are used to just jamming without a mix and you get to a show and you hear your band mixed for the first time it might through you off!</li>
                <li>Stands. Vocal Stands, Cab stands, Drum stands, all for positioning the mic in the room. (Important note) Put padding on the floor if you are on concrete!</li>
                <li>Sound Boards- The reverberations from concrete is insane and you will get feedback so easily that you won’t be able to turn up any of your mics to a level you can hear them well. If you are in a garage. PAD the garage door with fan fold. R5-R6 sheets of Styrofoam. There are also great Sound pads that are purposely formed for diffusing the sound. (see pic below)</li>

              </ul>
            <h3>Market Yourself</h3>
            <p>Social Media! Social Media is huge in the music industry. Get band pages on all the social media platforms. Get professional band Pics, get a good look! You aren’t just selling your music you are selling your style. Put samples of songs on your social media. Get a Reverb Nation account. Reverb Nation is a great website for local bands. It allows you to put you music up there for free or for a fee. It’s the next best thing besides your own band website. If you don’t have the money to build a website or don’t know how. Reverb Nation does a great job. Then make sure your social media has links to your Reverb Nation account.

              Get to know your music scene. There are many local bars, coffee shops, and venues. Reach out to them in person first. If they are unreachable reach out online and direct them to your page. Many venues are looking for great bands to bring in a crowd. If you are first starting off keep in mind that you will be paying to play. Meaning you will have to pay your own gas and not get paid for your show. Once you get a name for yourself and you have a following then make sure you get paid for your shows. Many venues offer a free bar tab. That’s great and all but if you want to be successful you need to start demanding your fee’s.</p>
              <h3>Stage Presence</h3>
              <p>There are tons of local bands. Many musicians who can play well. What is going to set you apart from them is not only playing with talent and sounding great, but PUTTING ON A SHOW! Get into the music! DO NOT just stand there. Play in front of friends and family first if you are nervous to get on stage. You’ll need to overcome your nerves and loose yourself in the music. If you aren’t into your music, I guarantee you your fans won’t be. Build Boxes to stand on, or put a leg up on. Get band Banners, and most importantly MERCH! Merch is how you will be able to scrape by. T-shirts, Stickers, Cd’s, gloves with your logo, hats, etc. get a lot of merch. Not only will you get more money from selling merch at your gigs and on social media, you are advertising!</p>
